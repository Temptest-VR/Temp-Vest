# Temp à§¹ Sense 
Open peltier based thermal haptics for Unity and VRChat.

TempSense is a project started at MIT Reality Hack 2025 which uses the ESP32 Platform and peltier modules to allow developers to integrate thermal haptics into their experiences, and for users to access a unique sensory experience when in VR.

# Communication protocol between ESP32 and Unity
ESP32 is always listening to Unity. Unity is broadcasing to ESP32 5Hz.
Information structure sent from Unity to ESP32:
`int int`
* first int: integer in range [-100, 100]. Left hand temperature control value. -100 is cold. 100 hot.
* second int: integer in range [-100, 100]. Right hand temperature control value. -100 is cold. 100 hot.
