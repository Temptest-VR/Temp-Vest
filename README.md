# Temp à§¹ Sense 
Open peltier based thermal haptics for Unity and VRChat.

TempSense is a project started at MIT Reality Hack 2025 which uses the ESP32 Platform and peltier modules to allow developers to integrate thermal haptics into their experiences, and for users to access a unique sensory experience when in VR.
